# 2nd_portfolio
The purpose the of a second portfolio is I have acquired a one-year domain through the GitHub Education Pack's partnership with Namecheap. I thought for something to host but in my mind I got nothing so I thought why don't I host my own portfolio instead. I want work in my project show showchaseing but it is time killing and I have other work to do
